This assignment involves creating a login page and four other pages (Home, About-us, Jobs, Contact) using React components and react-router. The login page should use the usernames and passwords created in the previous assignment to authenticate users.

The folder structure for the server-side code follows the REST API hierarchy with an entry point (Server.js), router (router.js), controller (controller.js), service (service.js), and model (model.js) files.

Additionally, a card component should be added to each page to display details about the page. At least one of the pages should be dynamically created using the react map() function.

The backend code is written in Node.js using the Express framework and MongoDB Atlas for database storage. The entry point of the application is the server.js file which sets up the Express app and defines the routes.

The mongoose package is used to create a connection with the MongoDB database. A user model is defined with three fields - fullName, email and passwordHash. The passwordHash field is used to store the hashed password of the user.

The bcrypt package is used for password encryption. When a new user is created, the password is hashed using the bcrypt.hash() function and then stored in the passwordHash field of the user model. When a user logs in, the stored password hash is compared with the entered password hash using the bcrypt.compare() function.

The express-validator package is used for data validation. When a new user is created, the body() function is used to validate the fullName, email and password fields. If there are any validation errors, a 422 status code is returned with the errors in the response.

The app defines three routes - user/create to create a new user, user/getAll to retrieve all users and api/login to handle user login requests. The user/create route accepts POST requests and expects a JSON payload containing the fullName, email and password fields. The api/login route also accepts POST requests and expects a JSON payload containing the email and password fields.

When a new user is created, the user data is saved to the database and a 201 status code is returned with a success message. If the email already exists in the database, a 422 status code is returned with an error message.

When a user logs in, the email and password are validated against the user data stored in the database. If the email or password is incorrect, a 401 status code is returned with an error message. If the login is successful, a 200 status code is returned with a success message.

In React, card components were created using the map() function to create multiple instances of a custom Card component. First, an array of data was defined, where each object in the array represented the content to be displayed in each card. Then, the map() function was used to create a new Card component instance for each object in the array, passing the content properties as props to the Card instance. Finally, all the Card instances were rendered inside a container element.

The Card component itself was defined separately in its own file and received the content properties as props. Inside the Card component, the content was rendered using HTML elements like img, h2, and p, and the styles for the Card component were defined in a separate CSS file using classes and IDs.

Overall, the map() function allowed for the creation of multiple instances of the Card component with different content, while the Card component itself defined the appearance and behavior of each card.
